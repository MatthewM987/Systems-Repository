# Student Data Management System

## Overview
This project was completed as part of the **Systems I** course at **The Ohio State University**.  
The goal was to use **linked lists** to build a functional system capable of tracking, modifying, and displaying a variety of data points for each student.

While designed for academic use, the same underlying structure can be adapted to many real-world scenarios where simple and efficient data storage is needed for large groups.
