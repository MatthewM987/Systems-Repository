This is a school project from the Systems 1 course at Ohio State. The goal was to use linked lists to create a working system to track, alter, and show a variety of different datapoints for each student. \n The same base code could be applied in many areas to create simple data storage system for a large group. It is run using C99 using the MakeFile included. 
Skills Used:
            1) Linked List Modification
            2) File Linkage
            3) Parameter Passing
In the future, more complex calculations can be added so that a student can be more accuratly assesed such as class rankings. Another future feature could be adding more flexiblity in the inputted data. At the moment, a user is limited to a concrete amount of grades and a concrete weighting system. This could be improved to allow users to customize the class setup to fit their own needs.
